How use that script:

Create a file called "duplicate_location.txt" in "C:\" path. After that, inside of that file, put the location where
the virus will spam files and folders. Preferably, put a path where has a lot of folders.

Finally, just run the "duplicate-files-virus.exe" file, which are inside of the "virus-file" folder.
