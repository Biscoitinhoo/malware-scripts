How use that script:

Create a text file called "duplicate_location" in "C:\" path. After that, inside of that file, put the location where
the virus will spam files and folders. Preferably, put a path where has a lot of folders.

Finally, go to the path "duplicate-files-virus\bin\Debug" and just run the
"duplicate-files-virus.exe" file.
