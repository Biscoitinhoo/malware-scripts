How to use that script:

First of all, install all the project dependencies. For it, you'll need the pip package manager.

pip install requests
pip install selenium

After that, install the ChromeDriver (http://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads) and put it in your C:/ path inside a folder called "browser".

C:/browser/chromedriver.exe

Make sure that you installed the correct ChromeDriver version.

Finaly, just run the script:

python3 script.py
or 
python2 script.py

Running the program, it will ask you for:

"Insert the website url:" -> Insert the website login page for brute-force.
"Insert the username/e-mail for brute-force:" -> The default username/e-mail for brute-force

"Insert the wordlist location:" The path of a wordlist. I highly recommend to install RockYou (https://github.com/brannondorsey/naive-hashcat/releases/download/data/rockyou.txt) wordlist.
