Malwares that I write for fun. DO NOT USE THIS ON YOUR OWN MACHINE. If you want to test something, install a VM.
Some malwares are made for run in specific hardwares (for example, bad-usb). All the hardwares are separated in different folders.
If something can be used without any external hardware, I put a .exe file for download.
